        <p>Kakashi Hatake (Japanese: はたけ カカシ, Hepburn: Hatake Kakashi) is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists in the
             Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series'
              primary characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, 
              resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, the featured
               films in the series, the original video animations, and the video games.

            Kakashi is depicted in Naruto as an eccentric but highly skilled shinobi for the Hidden Leaf Village. Initially cold and calculated
             due to the suicide of his father, Sakumo, Kakashi eventually began to warm up in his youth with the help of his teammate Obito Uchiha,
              while they are under the tutelage of Naruto's father Minato Namikaze. It is through Obito that Kakashi obtains the Uchiha clan's
               Sharingan, which he uses to copy the abilities of his opponents and make his own, but also drains his energy. Following the deaths
                of all of his squadmates, unaware of Obito's survival, Kakashi is eventually given charge of Team 7 due to his connections with
                 Minato and the Uchiha, and through them is able to finally have the family he never had. He is initially portrayed as a detached 
                 and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends, students, and the village becomes increasingly
                  apparent.</p>
            <p>Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki,
                 Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character and tends to lose track of time, being frequently late 
                 to his appointments as a result.[19] However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point
                  of fighting while reading Make Out (イチャイチャ, Icha Icha) series of erotic novels.[20] Kakashi is renowned throughout the
                   Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan, which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha, and is revered as the ninja who
                    has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker "Copy Ninja Kakashi" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) and
                     "Kakashi of the Sharingan" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements 
                     and jutsu of others.[21][22] Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the
                      Chidori (千鳥, lit. "One Thousand Birds") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand
                       that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target.[23] When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not take them
                        as his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them.[24]
                         Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through
                          to him before the latter's defection from Konoha.[25] Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various challenges by his
                           childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.
